# Epios

Thanks for visiting my final project from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive bootcamp.

Epios is an easy to use, proof of concept designed to tackle the paper-based inefficiencies that detract from the prescription fulfillment experience in Australian healthcare.

Epios has been built using the MEVN stack, i.e. Mongoose/Mongo DB, Express, Vue.js and Node.
